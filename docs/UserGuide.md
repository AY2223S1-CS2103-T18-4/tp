# ConnectNUS User Guide

ConnectNUS is **designed for NUS Computer Science students** by providing a centralised platform for them to keep track 
of their and their friends' modules and timetables. Capitalising on the features of adding previous, current and 
future modules, as well as timetables, ConnectNUS provides users with the convenience of viewing your friends' schedules
and eliminates the problem of having to search through multiple group and private chats to know when your friends will 
be free to meet up to do group projects. The module filter feature is a useful tool to help you find friends who are currently 
taking the same modules as you now or friends who are interested in taking the same modules together in the next semester.

ConnectNUS is **optimised for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a 
**Graphical User Interface** (GUI). For Computer Science students who are generally fast typers, ConnectNUS is an
excellent platform for you to get your contact management tasks done quickly, so you can save time and effort
finding out about your friends' schedules, and focus on getting your projects and module bidding done.

## Quick Start

1. Ensure you have Java 11 or above installed on your computer. You can refer to
[this](https://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/howto/jdk_howto.html#zz-2) guide to help you install and configure
an appropriate version of Java. You can open a command window and run the `java -version` command to ensure you are using 
Java 11 (or above).

2. Download the latest ConnectNUS.jar from [here](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T14-4/tp/releases/tag/v1.3).

![](images/QuickStart2.png)

3. Copy the file to a new empty folder you want to use as the home folder for ConnectNUS. A JSON file will be created in
the folder to store your data upon saving the jar file.

![](images/QuickStart3.png)

4. In terminal (Mac) or command prompt (Windows), navigate to the folder's path. For Mac users, you can do it by right-clicking on the folder
and click on `New Terminal at Folder` as illustrated below.

![](images/QuickStart4.png)

![](images/QuickStart5.png)

5. Launch the jar file using the `java -jar ConnectNUS.jar` command in the terminal. Do not double-click
on the jar file in the folder. This to ensure the jar file is using the correct Java version verified in Step 1.

6. The GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Do note that the app contains some sample data.

7. Refer to the [Features](#features) section below to for more details on how to use ConnectNUS.

## Navigating the User Guide
**Notes about the command format:**

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be **supplied by the user**. \
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are **optional**. \
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `‚Ä¶`‚Äã after them can be used **multiple times including zero times**. \
  e.g. `[t/TAG]‚Ä¶‚Äã` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be **in any order**. \
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, **only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken**. \
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.
* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored. \
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
